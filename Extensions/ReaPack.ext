@changelog
  Fixed:
  * browser: don't enable the selection-wide reinstall action if the current version is not in the repository
  * browser: fix the package list not being refreshed after toggling the pinned status without installing or removing packages (another v1.2rc1 regression)
  * browser: prevent selection-wide install/update action from installing an older version when the current one is not in the repository
  * linux: attempt to produce binaries compatible with more Linux flavors (such as Linux Mint)

  Changed:
  * browser: rename "Copy package names" back to "Copy package name" in context menu
  * browser: sort package types alphabetically in the filter menu (top right button)
  * edit the title of a few windows to match the action/menu name
